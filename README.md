# Overview
This repo contains my work for Fast AI's 2022 Practical Deep Learning for Coders.

## Directory
- diff_edit.ipynb: An implementation of [DiffEdit paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11427.pdf)
- stable_diffusion.ipynb: If you scroll down towards the bottom of the notebook, you'll see that I implemented `negative prompts` and `image to image` without using HuggingFace's pipeline.
- `01_matmul.ipynb`. I implemented matrix multiplication from first principles, instead of using PyTorch's default implementation.
